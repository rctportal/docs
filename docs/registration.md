# Account Registration

Welcome to the RCT Power Portal! Account registration is a simple process that allows both companies and end-users to
access the powerful features of our platform. Whether you're a company looking to manage multiple systems or an
individual end-user monitoring your PV system, we've got you covered.

## Registration Options

### Self-Registration for End-Users and Companies

- **End-User Registration:** Individual users can also register independently.
- **Company Registration:** Companies can register themselves to manage multiple systems under their account.

### Registration for End-Users by Company (Third Party)

End-users have the option to register with the assistance of a company (third party), streamlining the process for a
seamless experience.

:::tip
In order to avoid double registrations, a clear agreement should be made with the installer as to
which party/person will carry out the registration.
