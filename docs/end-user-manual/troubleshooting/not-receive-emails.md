## User Not Receiving Email

If you haven't received an email from the portal, follow these steps based on your account status:

### Already Working Account

- If you are not a new user and have not received an email (e.g., for a password reset), repeat the process using the
  same email address to avoid entry errors.
- If the problem persists, wait until the next day to account for temporary SMTP server issues.

### Newly Created Account

#### Self-Registration (self-registered at [RCT Portal Registration](https://rct-portal.com/registration/en))

- If you successfully created an account but haven't received an email,
  try [creating an account again](/end-user-manual/registration.md).

#### Registered by a Third Party (usually by the installer)

- If registered by the installer, contact the installer to verify the correct email address entry.
    - If the email is correct, contact RCT Power Portal support
      via [service@rct-power.com](mailto:service@rct-power.com).
    - If the email is incorrect, ask the installer to delete your account and recreate it using the correct email form.
