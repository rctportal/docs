# System Offline

If your system has been offline for more than 2 days, follow these steps to troubleshoot and restore connectivity:

## Step 1: Check Inverter Network Settings

- Ensure the connection is set up correctly using the guidelines in [Setting Up RCT Power Portal Connection](/end-user-manual/requirements.md).
- Confirm if an IP address is displayed on the inverter.

## Step 2: Verify Home Network and Internet Connection

- Inspect your home network settings and ensure a stable connection to the Internet.
- Refer to the steps in [Device Not Found](/end-user-manual/troubleshooting/device-not-found).

## Step 3: Check System Status on RCT Power Portal

- Log in to the RCT Power Portal and verify if the system is back online.

## Step 4: Contact Installer if System Remains Offline

- If the system persists offline and you cannot identify the issue, reach out to your installer or RCT Power Portal
  support via [service@rct-power.com](mailto:service@rct-power.com) for assistance.

## Step 5: Reboot System to Resolve Network Issues

- Turn the PV switch to the 0 position on the RCT inverter.
- Switch off the Power Battery (if available) by setting the button on the back of the Power Battery Master to 0.
- Allow a 10-minute interval.
- Switch both devices back on by setting them to the "1" position. Wait 5-10 minutes until data reappears on the portal.
