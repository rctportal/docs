# Account Registration

End-users have two registration options: independent registration or assisted registration by a company (third party).
This flexibility ensures a seamless and user-friendly experience.

:::tip
To avoid double registrations and ensure a smooth process, establish a clear agreement with the installer regarding
registration responsibilities.

## Self Registration

The portal defaults to English, with language switching available in the upper right corner.
