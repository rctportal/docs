# Setting Up RCT Power Portal Connection

In order to visualize the values of your PV system in the RCT Power Portal, you must follow these steps:

:::tip
Please note that the Control Software version 5369 or higher must be installed on the RCT Power Inverter to enable an error-free connection to the RCT portal.

For trouble-free operation, we recommend connecting your inverter to your home network via LAN or using a dLANÂ® Powerline adapter.

Inverters equipped with the WiFi_C1 module cannot be registered in the portal.

The WiFi_C1 module is easily recognizable by its missing LAN port on the corresponding power storage.

The following inverters are equipped with a WiFi_C2 module and a LAN connection and can be registered:

- Power Storage DC 6.0 ab Seriennummer 0065A4630282
- Power Storage DC 5.0 ab Seriennummer 0065A4530049
- DC 4.0 power storage from serial number 0065A4430027
- All Power Storage DC 8.0 and 10.0 models

Power Storage AC systems and installations with more than one Power Storage DC cannot be assigned in the current version of the RCT Power Portal.

## Troubleshooting Device Enrollment Issues

In the event that device enrollment issues occur during the enrollment process, and the "Device could not be found" information message is displayed, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

### Step 1: Double-check Inverter's Network Settings

- Ensure the inverter's network settings are configured correctly based on the provided instructions.

### Step 2: Log in to RCT Power Portal

- Log in to the [RCT Power Portal](https://rct-portal.com) and check if the device can be found.
- Allow at least 5 minutes after any adjustment of the network settings.

### Step 3: Check Internet Connection

- If the inverter is connected to the Internet via a Wi-Fi connection:
  - Verify the Wi-Fi connection with another device (ideally a laptop or smartphone).

- If the inverter is connected to the Internet via a LAN connection:
  - Disconnect the plug from the inverter and connect it to another device, ideally a laptop, to test the LAN connection.

### Step 4: DNS Check

- Open a web browser and visit [https://dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org).
